					<p>Es una de las comidas preferidas y consumidas por la mayoría en Latam. Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.
					Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, which are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.
					Beef from steers and heifers is similar. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.

					<p>Sushi (寿司) is a traditional food from Japan.
					The word "Sushi" comes from the Japanese word "Su" (酢) meaning vinegar, and "Meshi" (飯), meaning rice.
					Sushi is made with specially prepared rice, called sumeshi (酢飯). The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it, but it sometimes has non-fish foods such as vegetables. Some sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called nori (海苔).
					There are many different kinds of sushi. The most common sushi in Japan is nigirizushi (握り寿司): fish meat that is placed on top of a small portion of sumeshi. Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of the sumeshi, such as roe (fish eggs), and sea urchin meat, instead of fish. Another type of sushi, makizushi (巻き寿司), consists of sumeshi rolled around fish and/or vegetables. In the US, makizushi is more popular than nigirizushi. Another type is known as temaki (手巻き) or a hand roll. This kind of sushi comes in a cone-shape, created by the nori wrapped around the ingredients inside. They are usually filled with a mixture of sumeshi, fish, and vegetables.
					Sushi is eaten with your bare hands or chopsticks. Soy sauce and wasabi are commonly eaten with sushi. Gari (sweet, pickled ginger) can often be found alongside a plate of sushi and also a little bit of wasabi, used as a palate cleanser.
					In Japan, sushi is sometimes sold in "conveyor-belt shops" called kaiten zushi (回転寿司), where plates of sushi are put on a moving belt that passes by the customers. People freely take the sushi they want as it passes. The color of the plate shows the price of the sushi. This way of serving sushi is becoming more popular in other countries as well.
